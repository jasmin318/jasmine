<p><hr>HTML tags are the basic building blocks of any website. They are used to create web pages in various formats.HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and typically come in pairs, i.e. an opening tag and a closing tag.<br>
 The closing tag has same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash( / )character.<br>The opening tag specifies the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks the end.<br>
For Example:<p> is an opening tag for a paragraph,and</p>is its corresponding closing tag.<br>
<strike>> Most tags come in pairs, with opening and closing tags, although some tags don’t need to be closed (self-closing tags)</strike>.<br>
 Examples of self-closing tags are – <img>, <br>, …, etc. Essential tags for defining the HTML document structure are "<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>". </hr><br><br</P>
