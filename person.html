<h1>JASMINE</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated person with an urge to learn and grow. My name is Rakul, and I feel life is a journey that leads to self-discovery. <br>
I belong to a middle-class family, my father is a handloom businessman, and my mother is a primary school teacher.i am coming from the eastern side if my city.<br>
I have learned punctuality and discipline are the two wheels that drive our life on a positive path. My mother is my role model.<br>
I am passionate about reading novels. When I was younger, my grandmother used to narrate stories about her life in the past and that has built my interest towards reading stories and novels related to history.<br>
Overall I am an optimistic person who looks forward to life as a subject that teaches us values and ways to live for the upliftment of society.<br>
